# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts used car prices using machine learning. It applies data preprocessing, visualization, and regression models, with Random Forest giving the best performance.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation
- Random Forest Regressor as final model
- RMSE used as evaluation metric

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
- Achieved strong performance using Random Forest
- RMSE metric used to validate predictions

## Usage
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook: `jupyter notebook Purpose_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to reproduce results

Note: The original dataset is large and has not been included here. 
For demonstration, a sample dataset (sample_submission.csv) is provided. 
The code works the same way with the full dataset.
